## Decision Matrix

### Choose Fundamental Care If:

1. **Prescription drug coverage is critical** - Employees need regular medications
2. **Preventive care is a priority** - Want to offer wellness visits, immunizations
3. **Traditional medical model preferred** - Employees understand copays better than indemnity
4. **Lab work is frequent** - $0 lab benefit is valuable
5. **Chronic conditions present** - Diabetic coaching, high-cost drug program beneficial
6. **Employee advocacy needed** - Value of concierge service

### Choose Hooray Health If:

1. **Budget predictability critical** - 3-year rate guarantee provides stability
2. **Mobile workforce** - Employees travel or work across multiple locations
3. **Urgent care is primary usage** - $25 flat fee is substantial savings
4. **Virtual care adoption high** - Employees comfortable with telemedicine
5. **Administrative simplicity priority** - Want easy, automated enrollment
6. **Customer experience matters** - 86 NPS demonstrates member satisfaction
7. **Part-time/variable hour workforce** - Designed specifically for this population

### Consider Offering Both If:

- **Diverse workforce with different needs** - Full-time vs part-time, older vs younger
- **Different contribution levels** - Can offer choice to increase perceived value
- **Maximize participation** - Give employees options increases enrollment
- **Complement major medical** - One plan as base, other as supplement

---

## Compliance & Legal Considerations

### Important Disclosures

⚠️ **NEITHER PLAN IS ACA-COMPLIANT MAJOR MEDICAL**

Both Fundamental Care and Hooray Health are **limited benefit indemnity plans** that:
- Do NOT satisfy ACA individual mandate
- Do NOT provide "minimum value" for employer mandate purposes
- Are NOT comprehensive health insurance
- Should be clearly disclosed as supplemental/limited benefit products

### Regulatory Classification

| **Aspect** | **Classification** |
|------------|-------------------|
| Plan Type | Fixed indemnity / Limited benefit |
| Regulatory Body | State insurance department |
| ACA Status | Excepted benefit |
| ERISA Status | Subject to ERISA if employer-sponsored |
| HIPAA | Subject to HIPAA privacy rules |

### Marketing Requirements

When presenting these plans, must:
- ✅ Clearly disclose they are NOT major medical
- ✅ Explain benefit payment structure (indemnity vs. comprehensive)
- ✅ Disclose limitations and exclusions
- ✅ Not market as "health insurance" substitute
- ✅ Recommend as supplement to major medical or for specific populations

---

## Additional Considerations for Decision-Making

### 1. Employee Demographics Matter

**Age Distribution**:
- Younger employees (18-35): May prefer Hooray Health's mobile-first, urgent care focused model
- Middle age (35-50): May value FCLD's structured copays and prescription coverage
- Near-retirement (50+): Likely need more comprehensive coverage than either plan

**Technology Adoption**:
- High tech adoption: Hooray Health's app-based experience is advantage
- Lower tech adoption: FCLD's traditional model may be easier to understand

### 2. Industry Considerations

**Retail/Restaurant**: Hooray Health designed for this workforce (current clients include IHOP, Lululemon, Container Store)

**Healthcare/Senior Care**: FCLD offers diabetic coaching and patient advocacy valuable for this sector

**Staffing/Temporary**: Hooray Health's mobile access across states beneficial

### 3. Claims Experience & Administration

**FCLD**:
- Provider files claim to Web TPA
- Web TPA determines current policy and processes
- Member pays copay, plan pays 100% of covered expenses

**Hooray Health**:
- Provider files claim to Web TPA
- Web TPA determines current policy and pays fixed indemnity
- Member responsible for any difference between indemnity and actual cost
- Exception: Hooray Network urgent cares have $25 flat fee, no balance billing

### 4. Future Considerations

**Plan Sustainability**:
- Hooray Health's 3-year rate guarantee provides certainty
- FCLD's rate guarantee unknown - could increase annually

**Benefit Design Evolution**:
- Both plans may add/modify benefits over time
- Hooray Health adding ~25 urgent care locations monthly
- FCLD may expand Allied National lab network

**Market Trends**:
- Increased acceptance of virtual care (favors Hooray Health)
- Growing prescription drug costs (favors FCLD's actual coverage)
- Movement toward value-based care (both plans encourage appropriate utilization)
